## Installation

This software works on CFW and *hax/Rosalina-based Homebrew Launchers. An internet connection may be required at the first launch.

| Entrypoint | Instructions |
| :--------: | :----------- |
| CFW | Install the `PKSM.cia` file provided in the release page with your favourite installer. You can now launch the application from the Home Menu |
| Rosalina HBL | Move `PKSM.3dsx` from the rosalina folder in the `PKSM.zip` file. You can now launch PKSM from a [Rosalina-based Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu) |
| *hax HBL | Move `PKSM.3dsx` and `PKSM.xml` from the standard folder in the `PKSM.zip` file. You can now launch PKSM from a [*hax-based Homebrew Launcher](https://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/starter.zip) |

Initial launch will require your system to be connected to the internet. This is needed to download the additional assets required for the application to launch. If your system is not connected to the internet, you will get a **Failed to receive a status code** error.

You need internet access to download the additional assets. If you're unable to download them through the application, download and extract the [additionalassets](https://github.com/dsoldier/PKResources/releases/download/final/additionalassets.zip) folder in the `.zip` file to your SD card, at `/3ds/PKSM/`. The final result should be a folder filled with assets, located at `/3ds/PKSM/additionalassets/`.

### DS cartridges (*hax)

To let PKSM load your DS save correctly, you need to select a target title that has DS save access when selecting PKSM from the homebrew launcher.

A title satisfying those specifics is, for example, Poké Transporter.

### Storage changes from 5.0.0+

If you're coming from a PKSM version < 5.0.0, you'll notice your `bank.bin` file isn't recognized anymore. That's because the working path changed from 5.0.0 onwards, so you'll need to **manually move** your `bank.bin` file to the new location, from `/3ds/data/PKSM/bank/` to `/3ds/PKSM/bank`.

## Troubleshooting

Before submitting an issue, have a look through the issues page, because your question may have already been answered in the past.

Please only submit consistent issues (submitting your environment and which version of PKSM you're running), without asking for the moon: I'm working for free here. Duplicate issues will be closed without any reply.

I'll not reply to issues related to versions of PKSM different from the latest stable release currently available.

## Building

PKSM requires [latest libctru](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib), [latest citro3d](https://github.com/fincs/citro3d) and [latest pp2d](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM/tree/master/source/pp2d). The executable can be compiled with [devkitARM r47+](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/).To compile the .cia you need [3dstool](https://github.com/dnasdw/3dstool/releases), [bannertool and makerom](https://github.com/Steveice10/buildtools/tree/master/3ds) in your PATH. Run the command `make all` to build both the .3dsx and .cia.
